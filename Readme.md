EduSpring: Learn about IoC and DI concepts, with discussion about implementation in Spring.NET
==============================================================================================

Follow the projects in order.  You'll need to set each one as the startup project in turn.

1. **IoCWithoutSpring**:  This introduces you to what an IoC container really is: a dictionary with string keys and object values.
